*We'd like to get paid to work on some open source Rust project.*

We will
honor your priorities and the project's existing commitments,
work in the [mob programming format](#mob-programming),
and
publicly live stream our sessions.

Focus on collaboration leads to better software.
Human interaction leads to happier developers.
We don't solo-program.
We [mob program][mob programming].

We can upskill other developers, by including them in our sessions, for free.

We contribute frequently.
If we fall short of your expectations, terminate our work.
No prior notice.

We are colleagues and friends.
A collective.
We get paid via [our Open Collective].
