*We may not be* the most intelligent.
We may not be the most capable.
Nor the most talented.
Nor have the deepest expertise.

But we are professional software developers.
And we have decided to share our craft publicly.

If this helps you decide whether to pick up software as a profession or a hobby,
if this helps you become a professional,
if this helps you hone your craft,
if this merely entertains you,
then we are honored to have been of service.

Full,
un-edited,
sychronous collaboration
software development sessions,
on open source software,
publicly available,
for free.
