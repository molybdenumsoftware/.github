The Molybdenum Software Show is just some people having a good time doing open source together.
Our collaboration is in [remote mob programming format](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/#git-handover) with [git handover](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/#git-handover).
It is also an attempt to produce and provide free educational content.
We hope that it will be of value to some.
